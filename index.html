        <p>
            To be honest with you I have no idea what to put here but I decided to go with an ocean theme with the pictures and colors. To make this site marginally more useful though, the buttons all lead to the #TeamSeas website, so go donate and save the turtles!

        "This is an inspiring quote, or a testimonial from a customer. maybe it's just filling up space, or maybe people will actually read it. Who knows? All I know is that it looks nice. Furthermore, I'll add a few more sentences to make this paragraph longer. However, do not take this the wrong way! This isn't just so it fills up more space. Trust me. Also help clean the oceans and go donate to #TeamSeas!"
